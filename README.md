<h1>Red Bus Automation Solution </h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this project is to automate the process of searching buses on RedBus
between Mumbai â†’ Pune, applying filters (Primo and Evening), and handling lazy loading to ensure all bus results are captured until the "End of list" message appears.<br>
<br>This automation script demonstrates:</br>
<br>Browser automation using Selenium WebDriver.</br>
<br>Handling dynamic web elements and auto-suggestions.</br>
<br>Implementing explicit waits for stability.</br>
<br>Dealing with lazy loading using scroll actions.</br>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<br>Programming Language: Java (JDK 11)</br>
<br>Automation Framework: Selenium WebDriver</br>
<br>Build Tool: Maven </br>
<br>Browser: Google Chrome</br>
<br>Driver: ChromeDriver (compatible with Chrome browser version)</br>

<h2>Challenges Tackled</h2>
<h3>Dynamic Auto-Suggestions</h3>
Challenge: Auto-suggestions for "From" and "To" locations appeared asynchronously.<br>
Solution: Used explicit waits to ensure suggestions were visible before selecting.
<h3>Click Interception Errors</h3>
Challenge: Elements like Primo or Evening filters were sometimes overlapped by popups or banners.<br>
Solution: Applied wait until clickable + slight scroll into view.
<h3>Lazy Loading of Bus List</h3>
Challenge: The bus list loaded dynamically as the user scrolled.<br>
Solution: Implemented a scroll loop with JavaScriptExecutor until "End of list" was found.
<h3>Stability Across Multiple Runs</h3>
Challenge: Inconsistent behavior due to network speed and dynamic DOM changes.<br>
Solution: Added retry logic + explicit waits to improve reliability

<h2>How It Works</h2>
Launch Browser & Open Website-Chrome browser is launched and navigates to RedBus<br>
Select Source & Destination-Source location: Mumbai.<br>
Destination location: Pune<br>
Auto-suggestions are handled dynamically.<br>
Search for Buses<br>
Apply Filters-Primo and Evening<br>
Handle Lazy Loading<br>
